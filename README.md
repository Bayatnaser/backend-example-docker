# backend-example-docker

This project is created to help learn docker configurations for backend projects.

# Prerequisites

Install all packages with `npm install`

# Something about giving postgres database as argument

# Starting in production mode

To start the server in production mode: `npm start`

If your frontend is not running in the same origin, run the server with `FRONT_URL=<front-url> npm start` to allow cross-origin requests.

Test that the project is running by going to <http://localhost:8000>
